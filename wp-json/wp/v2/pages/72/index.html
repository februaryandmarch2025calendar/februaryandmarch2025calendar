The academic calendar of ERAU is an important aspect of student life as it outlines important dates for classes, exams, and breaks. In this article, we will discuss the academic calendar for 2024 and answer some common questions. <\/p>\n<h3>What is the Academic Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> The academic calendar is a schedule that outlines the important dates for each academic year, including the start and end of classes, exam dates, and breaks. It helps students plan their schedules for the year and ensures that they do not miss any important deadlines. <\/p>\n<h3>When does the Academic Year Start and End?<\/h3>\n<p> The academic year at ERAU typically starts in late August and ends in early May. The exact dates for the 2024 academic year have not been announced yet, but students can expect classes to start in the last week of August and end in the first week of May. <\/p>\n<h3>What are the Important Dates for the 2024 Academic Year?<\/h3>\n<p> The important dates for the 2024 academic year are as follows: &#8211; August 21, 2024: Move-In Day for New Students &#8211; August 23, 2024: First Day of Classes &#8211; November 27-December 1, 2024: Thanksgiving Break &#8211; December 10-15, 2024: Final Exams &#8211; December 16, 2024: Winter Break Begins &#8211; January 13, 2025: Winter Break Ends &#8211; January 14, 2025: Spring Semester Begins &#8211; March 7-14, 2025: Spring Break &#8211; April 28-May 3, 2025: Final Exams &#8211; May 4, 2025: Graduation Day <\/p>\n<h3>How Many Breaks are There in the 2024 Academic Year?<\/h3>\n<p> There are two major breaks in the 2024 academic year: Thanksgiving Break and Spring Break. Thanksgiving Break is from November 27 to December 1, 2024, while Spring Break is from March 7 to 14, 2025. Additionally, there is a Winter Break from December 16, 2024, to January 13, 2025. <\/p>\n<h3>Can Students Take Classes During Breaks?<\/h3>\n<p> No, students are not allowed to take classes during breaks. Breaks are meant for students to relax and recharge before the next semester begins. However, some students may choose to use this time to study or work on projects. <\/p>\n<h3>What Happens if a Student Misses an Exam?<\/h3>\n<p> If a student misses an exam due to a valid reason, such as illness or a family emergency, they may be allowed to take a makeup exam. However, this is up to the discretion of the professor. It is important for students to inform their professors as soon as possible if they are unable to attend an exam. <\/p>\n<h3>What is Graduation Day?<\/h3>\n<p> Graduation Day is the day when students receive their degrees and officially graduate from ERAU. The date for Graduation Day in 2025 is May 4. Students must apply to graduate and meet all the requirements for their degree before they can participate in the graduation ceremony. <\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p> The academic calendar is an important aspect of student life at ERAU. It helps students plan their schedule for the year and ensures that they do not miss any important deadlines. The 2024 academic calendar includes important dates such as the start and end of classes, exam dates, and breaks. Students should familiarize themselves with the calendar and plan accordingly to ensure a successful academic year. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"EmbryRiddle Releases Spring 2021 Academic Calendar EmbryRiddle\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/news.erau.edu\/-\/media\/images\/news\/news-headlines\/2020---sept-dec\/db-pc-sidebyside-cropped.jpg?h=515&amp;la=en&amp;w=1200&amp;hash=F12A279AB8C63987D1AD81B7CA5924E061F596F6\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>news.erau.edu<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Embry Riddle Schedule A Visit Riddles For Fun\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/24\/75\/c7\/2475c7e371f506ae401afe95340e2e4d.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>funriddlesforyou.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Embry Riddle Calendar 2021 2021 Calendar Template 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendaron2017.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/embry-riddle-aeronautical-university-daytona-beach-scaled.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>calendaron2017.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Embry Riddle Calendar 2020 2020 Calendar Template 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendaron2017.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/calendaracademic.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>calendaron2017.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Kappa Phi EmbryRiddle Aeronautical University EmbryRiddle\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/img.favpng.com\/15\/17\/0\/kappa-phi-embry-riddle-aeronautical-university-embry-riddle-aeronautical-university-organization-campus-png-favpng-KU9kVJuMuvJaW48JDmH0uhRsp.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>favpng.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"ERLI Calendar Embry Riddle Aeronautical University\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/erau.edu\/-\/media\/files\/daytona-beach\/international-student-services\/erli\/summer-visual-schedule.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>erau.edu<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"EmbryRiddle Aeronautical University Parent &amp; Family Guide by\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/image.isu.pub\/190807213156-94606194ba800edd2af7671a5489acbb\/jpg\/page_1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>issuu.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Embry Riddle Aeronautical University Daytona Beach Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/daytonabeach.erau.edu\/-\/media\/images\/daytona-beach\/sliders\/student-union-slider.jpg?as=0&amp;hash=FC5B047F158C188A85F081C510FCADF5\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>collegelearners.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Embry Riddle Schedule A Visit Riddles For Fun from funriddlesforyou.blogspot.com Introduction Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, also known as ERAU, is a prestigious university that specializes in aviation,&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/72"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=72"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/72\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=72"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
