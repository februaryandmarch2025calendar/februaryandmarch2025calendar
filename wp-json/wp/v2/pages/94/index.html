It then creates a schedule for the entire year, outlining when the child will be with each parent.

The calculator also takes into account holidays and school breaks, ensuring that both parents have equal time with the child. <\/p>\n<h2>Using the Every Other Weekend Calendar Calculator for 2024<\/h2>\n<p> If you&#8217;re looking to use the every other weekend calendar calculator for the year 2024, there are a few things you should know.
