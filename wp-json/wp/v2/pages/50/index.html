Understanding these changes is important for both parties to navigate the recruiting process successfully.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the NCAA Women&#8217;s Lacrosse Recruiting Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The NCAA women&#8217;s lacrosse recruiting calendar outlines periods during which coaches can contact and evaluate high school athletes. The calendar is designed to ensure that the recruiting process is fair for all athletes and that coaches have equal opportunities to evaluate and communicate with prospects.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Changes in the 2024 NCAA Women&#8217;s Lacrosse Recruiting Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The 2024 NCAA women&#8217;s lacrosse recruiting calendar features a new recruiting dead period from June 1 to June 20, during which coaches cannot have any in-person contact with prospects. Additionally, the evaluation period has been extended from September to November, allowing coaches more time to evaluate prospects during the fall season.<\/p>\n<h2>How do these Changes Affect Coaches?<\/h2>\n<p>Coaches must be aware of the new dead period and adjust their recruiting schedules accordingly. During the dead period, coaches cannot visit high schools or attend games, tournaments, or camps. However, they can still communicate with prospects through phone calls, texts, and email.<\/p>\n<p>The extended evaluation period gives coaches more time to evaluate prospects during the fall season, which is important because many high school tournaments and showcases take place during this time.<\/p>\n<h2>How do these Changes Affect Athletes?<\/h2>\n<p>Athletes must be aware of the new recruiting dead period and understand that coaches cannot have any in-person contact during this time. However, athletes can still communicate with coaches through phone calls, texts, and email.<\/p>\n<p>The extended evaluation period gives athletes more opportunities to showcase their skills during the fall season. Athletes should take advantage of these opportunities to catch the attention of college coaches.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The changes in the 2024 NCAA women&#8217;s lacrosse recruiting calendar will have an impact on both coaches and athletes. Coaches must adjust their recruiting schedules to account for the new dead period, while athletes should take advantage of the extended evaluation period to showcase their skills.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: What is the NCAA women&#8217;s lacrosse recruiting calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The NCAA women&#8217;s lacrosse recruiting calendar outlines periods during which coaches can contact and evaluate high school athletes.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What are the changes in the 2024 NCAA women&#8217;s lacrosse recruiting calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The 2024 NCAA women&#8217;s lacrosse recruiting calendar features a new recruiting dead period from June 1 to June 20, during which coaches cannot have any in-person contact with prospects.
