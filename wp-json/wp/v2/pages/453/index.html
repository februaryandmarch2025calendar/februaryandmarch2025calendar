This is a time when people celebrate the bounty of the harvest and enjoy the many different types of fruit that are available. Peaches, plums, apricots, and pears are just a few of the fruits that are in season during this time.<\/p>\n<h3>The Second Decade: Vegetables<\/h3>\n<p>The second ten days of Fructidor are focused on vegetables. This is a time when people celebrate the many different types of vegetables that are grown in France. Tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, and eggplant are just a few of the vegetables that are in season during this time.<\/p>\n<h3>The Third Decade: Celebrations<\/h3>\n<p>The final ten days of Fructidor are dedicated to celebrations. This is a time when people come together to celebrate the end of the harvest season and enjoy the fruits and vegetables that have been grown. Festivals and fairs are held throughout France, and people gather to share food, drink, and good company.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: What was the purpose of the French Revolutionary Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The French Revolutionary Calendar was created to reflect the values of the revolution and break away from the traditional calendar system that was associated with the monarchy and the Catholic Church.
