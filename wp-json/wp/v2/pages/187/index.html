However, users have reported issues with sharing their calendars with others. Many have complained that their shared calendars are not showing up or updating properly. This can be frustrating for those who rely on the app for their daily activities.<\/p>\n<h2>The Cause<\/h2>\n<p>There are several reasons why Apple Calendar sharing may not be working. One reason could be a problem with the user&#8217;s internet connection. If the user&#8217;s internet connection is slow or unreliable, it may cause issues with syncing the calendar with other devices. Another possible cause could be a problem with the user&#8217;s Apple ID. If the user&#8217;s Apple ID is not working properly, it may prevent them from sharing their calendar with others.<\/p>\n<h2>The Solution<\/h2>\n<p>If you are experiencing issues with Apple Calendar sharing, there are several steps you can take to resolve the problem. First, check your internet connection to make sure it is working properly. If it is slow or unreliable, try resetting your modem or router. You can also try connecting to a different network to see if that solves the problem.<\/p>\n<p>If the issue persists, try resetting your Apple ID password. This can be done by going to the Apple ID website and following the prompts to reset your password. Once you have reset your password, try sharing your calendar again to see if the problem has been resolved.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<p>Q: What should I do if resetting my internet connection and Apple ID password doesn&#8217;t work?<\/p>\n<p>A: If resetting your internet connection and Apple ID password doesn&#8217;t work, you may need to contact Apple Support for further assistance. They can help you troubleshoot the issue and provide additional solutions to resolve the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Q: Can I still use Apple Calendar if sharing is not working?<\/p>\n<p>A: Yes, you can still use Apple Calendar even if sharing is not working. However, you may need to manually enter events and appointments into your calendar if you are not able to sync with others. This can be time-consuming and may not be ideal for those who rely on the app for their daily activities.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Apple Calendar sharing is a convenient feature that allows users to easily sync their calendars with others. However, issues with sharing can be frustrating and may prevent users from using the app to its full potential. By following the steps outlined above, users can troubleshoot and resolve issues with sharing their calendars, ensuring that they can continue to use the app with ease.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The Complete Guide for Apple Calendar Any.do blog\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blogdh.any.do\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/elcapitan-ios9-keep-cal-updated-hero.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.any.do<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Family Sharing and family calendar ???
