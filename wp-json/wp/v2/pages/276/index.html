This has caused a lot of confusion and frustration among users. In this article, we will discuss the issue and provide some solutions.<\/p>\n<h3>What Is the Issue?<\/h3>\n<p>The issue is that when users open the iPhone Calendar app and navigate to the year 2024, they are unable to see any invitations for events. This means that they cannot accept or decline any event invitations for that year. This issue has been reported by many users and seems to be affecting all iPhone models.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Is This Happening?<\/h3>\n<p>There is no official explanation from Apple as to why this is happening. However, some experts believe that it may be a bug in the system.

To check for updates, go to Settings > General > Software Update.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Restart Your iPhone<\/h4>\n<p>Restarting your iPhone may help resolve the issue. To do this, press and hold the power button until the &#8220;slide to power off&#8221; slider appears. Slide it to the right to turn off your iPhone. Once it is off, press and hold the power button again until the Apple logo appears.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Check Your Calendar Settings<\/h4>\n<p>Make sure that your calendar settings are correct. Go to Settings > Calendar and make sure that all the necessary calendars are turned on. Also, make sure that the &#8220;Show Invitations in Other Calendars&#8221; option is turned on.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Use a Third-Party Calendar App<\/h4>\n<p>If none of the above solutions work, you may want to try using a third-party calendar app. There are many options available on the App Store that may work better for you.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>The iPhone Calendar issue of no invitations for events in the year 2024 is a frustrating problem for many users.
