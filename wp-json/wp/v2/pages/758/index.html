This calendar is designed to help students, teachers, and parents plan their schedules for the upcoming school year. In this article, we will take a closer look at the calendar, discuss some of the important dates, and answer some common questions. <\/p>\n<h3>When Does the School Year Begin?<\/h3>\n<p> The first day of school for students in the Cobb County School District for the 2024-2025 school year is August 5, 2024. This is a Monday and marks the beginning of the fall semester. Teachers will report to work a few days earlier, on August 1, 2024. <\/p>\n<h3>When Are the Holidays?<\/h3>\n<p> There are several holidays throughout the school year, including Labor Day (September 2, 2024), Thanksgiving Break (November 25-29, 2024), Winter Break (December 23, 2024 &#8211; January 3, 2025), and Spring Break (April 7-11, 2025). There are also several teacher workdays and early release days throughout the year. For a full list of dates, please refer to the official calendar. <\/p>\n<h3>What About Graduation?<\/h3>\n<p> Graduation ceremonies for the Class of 2025 will be held on May 22, 2025. Each high school in the district will have its own ceremony, which will be held at a local venue. More information about graduation will be provided closer to the date. <\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>What Do I Need to Know About the First Day of School?<\/h3>\n<p> On the first day of school, students will need to arrive at their respective schools by the designated start time. Parents are encouraged to drop off their children early in order to avoid traffic and ensure that they are not late for class. Students should also bring any required supplies, such as textbooks and notebooks. <\/p>\n<h3>What Should I Do if My Child is Sick?<\/h3>\n<p> If your child is sick and unable to attend school, you should contact the school as soon as possible. You may be required to provide a doctor&#8217;s note in order for your child&#8217;s absence to be excused. It is important to keep up with missed assignments and make-up work in order to ensure that your child stays on track with their studies. <\/p>\n<h3>What Happens if There is Inclement Weather?<\/h3>\n<p> In the event of inclement weather, the district may choose to close schools or delay the start of the school day. Parents will be notified of any closures or delays through the district&#8217;s website, social media, and local news outlets. It is important to have a plan in place in case of inclement weather, such as arranging for alternative transportation or having a backup childcare plan. <\/p>\n<h3>What Are the Attendance Policies?<\/h3>\n<p> Attendance is important for student success, and the district has several policies in place to encourage regular attendance. Students who miss more than a certain number of days may be subject to disciplinary action, including loss of credit or retention. However, the district also recognizes that there may be extenuating circumstances that require absences, and parents are encouraged to communicate with the school in these cases. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> The Cobb County School Calendar for the 2024-2025 school year provides important information for students, parents, and teachers. By understanding the key dates and policies, everyone can work together to ensure a successful school year. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact your child&#8217;s school or visit the district&#8217;s website for more information. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County School District Holidays 20212022 Calendar School\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/schooldistrictcalendars.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cobb-County-School-District-Calendar-2021-2022.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>schooldistrictcalendars.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County Schools 201617 calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.myajc.com\/rf\/image_large\/Pub\/p8\/AJC\/2017\/01\/03\/Images\/Cobb%20County%20Schools%202016-2017.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.myajc.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County Schools 2021 22 Calendar 2021 Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/y_rDxwrGi5UxPLXe2u6lBPBxnabe2jq4FVNoDlBLvU7wtAV-TFBwREf1fnT6tt2v_pVRfbKAT9-jGZaUP0h6mYNRzZLp6J6HfrR-NeLHQHSqRiNhaiNT4XuJxvpxwtIqkzLr51_pg6I=s0-d\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>haroldhedwig.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County Schools Calendar 2021 22 2021 Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/gSbfiHd32xw0mgObA-rK9JbqILV6CY8rUHGJBaN-GW0MF77qeihEhgGfvGpb5FDD3LmZOyiQD4Pt6tz0wGfuId6gBIxLfzC3Ra1AvAPj-QJOhQCbnVgvwaL2uRGrugnXjXe9oR6YwB-oeLpUZhyGhJQ=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>haroldhedwig.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County School Calendar 20242025\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.marietta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cobb-County-School-Calendar-2024-2025.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.marietta.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County School District Holidays 20212022 Calendar School\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/schooldistrictcalendars.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cobb-County-School-District-Proposed-Calendar-2021-2022.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>schooldistrictcalendars.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County School Calendar 20232024\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.marietta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cobb-County-School-Calendar-2023-2024-v2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.marietta.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mrs. Heller&#039;s Kindergarten Class Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-1RFGADhw3Bs\/XTySXX5ezNI\/AAAAAAAA16w\/XjZI_5eYup4rGxy6DTfQRn246oJwFVwQACLcBGAs\/s1600\/Cobb%2BCounty%2BCalendar%2B2019-2020.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>mrshellerskindergarten.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mrs. Heller&#039;s Kindergarten Class Calendar from mrshellerskindergarten.blogspot.com Introduction The Cobb County School District has released the calendar for the 2024-2025 school year.
