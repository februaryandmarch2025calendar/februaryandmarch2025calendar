This decision has upset many parents who feel that their children are being denied the opportunity to celebrate important cultural and religious holidays.<\/p>\n<h3>What Holidays are being Banned?<\/h3>\n<p>The holidays that are being banned by Banning Lewis Ranch Academy for the year 2024 include Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving.

They feel that their children are being denied the opportunity to celebrate important holidays and learn about different cultures and traditions. Some parents have even started a petition to get the academy to reverse its decision.<\/p>\n<h2>Arguments in Favor of the Ban<\/h2>\n<h3>Creating Inclusivity<\/h3>\n<p>One of the main arguments in favor of the ban is that it creates a more inclusive environment for all students. By not celebrating specific holidays, the academy is able to avoid excluding students who do not celebrate those holidays.<\/p>\n<h3>Teaching Tolerance<\/h3>\n<p>Another argument in favor of the ban is that it teaches tolerance and respect for other cultures and traditions. By not focusing on specific holidays, the academy is able to teach students about different cultures and traditions in a more holistic way.<\/p>\n<h2>Arguments Against the Ban<\/h2>\n<h3>Denying Cultural and Religious Traditions<\/h3>\n<p>One of the main arguments against the ban is that it denies students the opportunity to celebrate important cultural and religious traditions. Many parents feel that their children are being denied the opportunity to learn about their own cultural and religious traditions.<\/p>\n<h3>Creating Division<\/h3>\n<p>Another argument against the ban is that it creates division among students. By not celebrating specific holidays, the academy is creating a divide between students who celebrate those holidays and those who do not. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion among students.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The controversy surrounding the Banning Lewis Ranch Academy calendar for the year 2024 is a complex issue that has sparked debates on both sides. While the ban may create a more inclusive environment and teach tolerance, it also denies students the opportunity to celebrate important cultural and religious traditions. Ultimately, it is up to the academy to decide whether or not to reverse its decision.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Why did Banning Lewis Ranch Academy ban certain holidays?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Banning Lewis Ranch Academy decided to ban certain holidays in order to create a more inclusive environment for all students.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What holidays are being banned?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The holidays that are being banned by Banning Lewis Ranch Academy for the year 2024 include Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What is the response to the ban?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Many parents have expressed their disappointment and anger at the academy&#8217;s decision.
