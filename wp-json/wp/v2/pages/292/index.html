This calendar was based on the cycles of the moon and the sun, and it had 12 months in a year. The year was divided into two seasons, with six months in each season. The first season was called the &#8220;warm season,&#8221; and the second season was called the &#8220;cold season.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Roman Empire calendar was different from the modern Gregorian calendar that we use today. For example, the Roman Empire calendar had only 355 days in a year, so they had to add an extra month every few years to keep the calendar in sync with the seasons.<\/p>\n<h2>7 Little Words<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of word games, you may have heard of &#8220;7 Little Words.&#8221; This game provides players with seven clues and seven scrambled words that they need to unscramble to solve the puzzle.
