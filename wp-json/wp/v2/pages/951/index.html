The school district recently released the calendar escolar for the 2024-2025 academic year, and there are some important dates and changes to be aware of. In this article, we&#8217;ll go over the key details of the calendar and answer some common questions.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Calendar Escolar?<\/h3>\n<p>The calendar escolar is the official school calendar for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. It outlines the start and end dates of the school year, as well as important holidays, breaks, and teacher planning days. The calendar is released well in advance to allow families and staff to plan accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>When Does the School Year Start and End?<\/h3>\n<p>The 2024-2025 school year in Miami-Dade County will start on Monday, August 19, 2024, and end on Friday, June 6, 2025. This is a slight change from the previous year, which started on August 21 and ended on June 5.<\/p>\n<h3>What Holidays and Breaks are Included?<\/h3>\n<p>The calendar includes all major holidays, including Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Winter Break, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Spring Break, and Memorial Day. In addition, there are several teacher planning days throughout the year where students do not have school.<\/p>\n<h3>Are There Any Changes to the Schedule?<\/h3>\n<p>One notable change to the schedule for the 2024-2025 school year is that there will be no early release days. In previous years, students were released early on certain days to allow for teacher planning and professional development. However, this practice has been discontinued for the upcoming year.<\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>What should I do if I have questions about the calendar escolar?<\/h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the calendar escolar, you should contact your child&#8217;s school directly. They will be able to provide you with more detailed information and address any specific concerns you may have.<\/p>\n<h3>Can I request time off during the school year?<\/h3>\n<p>If you need to take time off during the school year for a family vacation or other reason, you should contact your child&#8217;s school as soon as possible. They will be able to provide you with more information on the district&#8217;s policies regarding absences and make arrangements for your child&#8217;s education while they are away.<\/p>\n<h3>What should I do if there are changes to the calendar after it has been released?<\/h3>\n<p>If there are any changes or updates to the calendar escolar after it has been released, the school district will communicate these changes to families and staff as soon as possible. You should also check the district&#8217;s website and social media channels for the latest updates.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the consequences of my child missing school?<\/h3>\n<p>Regular attendance is important for your child&#8217;s academic success. If your child misses too many days of school, they may fall behind in their coursework and struggle to catch up. In addition, excessive absences can result in truancy charges and legal consequences for parents and students.<\/p>\n<h3>Are there any resources available to help my child if they are struggling in school?<\/h3>\n<p>If your child is struggling in school, there are several resources available to help them succeed. You can contact your child&#8217;s teacher or school counselor for support, or seek out tutoring or mentoring programs in your community.
