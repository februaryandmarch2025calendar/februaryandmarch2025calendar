With Google Calendar, you can create events, set reminders, and invite other people to join your events.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll show you how to invite people to a Google Calendar event in 2024. Whether you&#8217;re planning a business meeting, a family reunion, or a birthday party, this guide will help you get started.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating a New Event<\/h2>\n<p>The first step in inviting people to a Google Calendar event is to create a new event. To do this, click on the &#8220;Create&#8221; button in the top left corner of your Google Calendar page. This will open a new window where you can enter the details of your event.<\/p>\n<p>Give your event a title, choose a date and time, and add any additional details you want to include. You can also set reminders and add attachments if needed.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: How do I invite people to my event?<\/h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve created your event, the next step is to invite people to join. To do this, click on the &#8220;Guests&#8221; tab in the event window. This will open a new window where you can enter the email addresses of the people you want to invite.<\/p>\n<p>You can also choose whether you want to allow guests to modify the event or just view it. Once you&#8217;ve added all your guests, click on the &#8220;Save&#8221; button to send out the invitations.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: What if I need to make changes to my event after I&#8217;ve invited people?<\/h3>\n<p>If you need to make changes to your event after you&#8217;ve invited people, you can easily do so by clicking on the event in your Google Calendar and making the necessary changes. Once you&#8217;ve saved your changes, an email notification will be sent out to all your guests with the updated information.<\/p>\n<h2>Managing Invitations<\/h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve invited people to your event, you can manage their responses by clicking on the event in your Google Calendar. This will show you a list of all the guests you&#8217;ve invited and their RSVP status.<\/p>\n<p>If someone has accepted your invitation, you&#8217;ll see a green checkmark next to their name. If someone has declined, you&#8217;ll see a red X next to their name. You can also send reminders or messages to your guests directly from this page.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: What if I need to invite more people after I&#8217;ve already sent out invitations?<\/h3>\n<p>If you need to invite more people to your event after you&#8217;ve already sent out invitations, you can do so by clicking on the event in your Google Calendar and adding their email addresses to the &#8220;Guests&#8221; tab. Once you&#8217;ve saved your changes, an email notification will be sent out to the new guests with the invitation details.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Inviting people to a Google Calendar event is easy and convenient. With just a few clicks, you can schedule an event, invite guests, and manage responses all in one place.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re planning a small get-together or a large conference, Google Calendar is the perfect tool to help you stay organized and on top of your schedule.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A Calendar Invite Will Follow Shortly\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.ringcentral.com\/us\/en\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/google-calendars-integration-with-ringcentral-1024x674.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>onvacationswall.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How To Forward A Calendar Invite In Gmail\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/karenapp.io\/books\/gc\/images\/guide\/question_59_image2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>onvacationswall.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to invite people to your Google Calendar?
