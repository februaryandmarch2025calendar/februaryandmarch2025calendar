The festival is dedicated to Goddess Durga, who is worshipped in nine different forms over the nine days. Navratri means &#8220;nine nights&#8221; in Sanskrit. During the festival, people fast, perform puja, and participate in cultural events that celebrate the victory of good over evil.<\/p>\n<h2>When is Navratri 2024?<\/h2>\n<p>Navratri 2024 will begin on Saturday, 28 September and end on Sunday, 6 October. The festival is celebrated twice a year, in the months of March-April (Chaitra Navratri) and September-October (Sharad Navratri). Sharad Navratri, which falls in September-October, is the more popular of the two.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Nine Days of Navratri?<\/h2>\n<p>Each of the nine days of Navratri is dedicated to a different form of Goddess Durga. The nine forms are: Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kalaratri, Mahagauri, and Siddhidatri. The tenth day, which is known as Vijayadashami or Dussehra, marks the end of the festival.<\/p>\n<h2>How is Navratri Celebrated?<\/h2>\n<p>Navratri is celebrated in different ways across India. In some parts of the country, people fast for all nine days and eat only one meal per day. In other parts, people fast for the first and last day of the festival. During the festival, people perform puja, decorate their homes with flowers and lights, and participate in cultural events like dandiya and garba.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Dandiya and Garba?<\/h2>\n<p>Dandiya and Garba are traditional folk dances that are performed during Navratri. Dandiya is a dance form that originated in Gujarat, and is performed with sticks. Garba is a circular dance that is performed around a lamp or a statue of Goddess Durga. Both dances are performed in colorful traditional attire and are accompanied by music.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Significance of Navratri?<\/h2>\n<p>Navratri is a festival that celebrates the victory of good over evil. It is believed that during the nine days of the festival, Goddess Durga fought and defeated the demon Mahishasura. The festival is also a celebration of the changing seasons, as it is celebrated during the transition from monsoon to winter.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Some Popular Navratri Foods?<\/h2>\n<p>During Navratri, people fast and avoid eating non-vegetarian food, onion, garlic, and grains like rice and wheat. Instead, they eat foods made from buckwheat flour, amaranth flour, and potato. Some popular Navratri foods include sabudana khichdi, kuttu ki puri, and singhare ki poori.<\/p>\n<h2>How is Navratri Celebrated in Different Parts of India?<\/h2>\n<p>Navratri is celebrated in different ways across India. In Gujarat, people perform dandiya and garba, and dress up in colorful traditional attire. In West Bengal, the festival is celebrated as Durga Puja, and large pandals are set up to welcome the Goddess. In North India, people fast and perform puja, and on the tenth day, effigies of Ravana are burned to celebrate the victory of Lord Rama over evil.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Some Precautions to Take During Navratri?<\/h2>\n<p>During Navratri, it is important to take some precautions to stay healthy. People who are fasting should make sure to stay hydrated and eat foods that are high in nutrients. It is also important to avoid overexertion and to get enough rest. Pregnant women and people with medical conditions should consult their doctor before fasting.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Navratri is a festival that is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor across India. The festival is a celebration of the victory of good over evil, and is an occasion for people to come together and participate in cultural events. Whether you are fasting, performing puja, or dancing to dandiya and garba, Navratri is a time to celebrate the joy of life and the changing seasons.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Gupta Navratri 2021 Date in India Calendar Magh Gupta Navratri 2021 Date\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/indianastrology.co.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/gupt-navratri-2021.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>indianastrology.co.in<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2021!
