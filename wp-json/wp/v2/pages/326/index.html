One policy that has become increasingly popular is the rolling calendar year attendance policy. This policy can be confusing for employees, so we&#8217;ve put together this guide to help you understand how it works.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Rolling Calendar Year Attendance Policy?<\/h2>\n<p>A rolling calendar year attendance policy is a policy that tracks an employee&#8217;s attendance over a 12-month period that starts on the employee&#8217;s hire date. This means that an employee&#8217;s attendance is evaluated based on the past 12 months, rather than the traditional calendar year.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does it Work?<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say an employee is hired on January 1, 2024. Their attendance will be tracked for the next 12 months, from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. On January 1, 2025, their attendance will be evaluated again based on the previous 12 months, from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>This means that an employee&#8217;s attendance record is constantly changing, and they are always working towards meeting the attendance requirements for the next 12-month period.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Do Companies Use a Rolling Calendar Year Attendance Policy?<\/h2>\n<p>Companies use a rolling calendar year attendance policy for a few reasons. First, it allows for more flexibility in tracking attendance. Second, it ensures that employees are held accountable for their attendance, regardless of when they were hired. Finally, it aligns with the company&#8217;s fiscal year, which may not be the same as the traditional calendar year.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does a Rolling Calendar Year Attendance Policy Impact Employees?<\/h3>\n<p>For employees, a rolling calendar year attendance policy means that their attendance is constantly being evaluated. It also means that they may have to work harder to meet the attendance requirements, as their attendance record is constantly changing.<\/p>\n<p>However, a rolling calendar year attendance policy can also be beneficial for employees. It allows for more flexibility in taking time off, as they are not restricted to a traditional calendar year. It also means that they have more opportunities to improve their attendance record, as they are constantly working towards meeting the requirements for the next 12-month period.<\/p>\n<h2>What Happens if an Employee Does Not Meet the Attendance Requirements?<\/h2>\n<p>If an employee does not meet the attendance requirements for a rolling calendar year, they may face consequences such as disciplinary action or termination. However, most companies will have a system in place to address extenuating circumstances, such as a serious illness or family emergency.<\/p>\n<h3>Can Employees Appeal a Decision Based on the Rolling Calendar Year Attendance Policy?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, employees can appeal a decision based on the rolling calendar year attendance policy. Most companies will have a process in place for employees to appeal disciplinary action or termination based on attendance.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>A rolling calendar year attendance policy can be confusing for employees, but it provides more flexibility for employers and ensures that employees are held accountable for their attendance. By understanding how the policy works and how it impacts them, employees can work towards meeting the attendance requirements and avoid disciplinary action or termination.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions about the rolling calendar year attendance policy at your company, be sure to speak with your HR representative.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer:<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: What is a rolling calendar year attendance policy?<\/h3>\n<p>A: A rolling calendar year attendance policy is a policy that tracks an employee&#8217;s attendance over a 12-month period that starts on the employee&#8217;s hire date.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: How does a rolling calendar year attendance policy impact employees?<\/h3>\n<p>A: For employees, a rolling calendar year attendance policy means that their attendance is constantly being evaluated.
