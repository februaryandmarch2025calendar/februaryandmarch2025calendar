The calendar was used to track the cycles of the sun, moon, and planets, and was also used to predict important events such as eclipses and the changing of the seasons.<\/p>\n<h2>The Long Count Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most famous calendars of the Mayan civilization is the Long Count calendar. This calendar is based on a cycle of 5,126 years and is divided into smaller cycles of 20 years, which are known as katuns. Each katun is further divided into baktuns, which are cycles of 144,000 days.<\/p>\n<h3>How Many Days are in the Mayan Calendar 2024?<\/h3>\n<p>According to the Long Count calendar, the year 2024 falls within the 14th baktun, which began on August 11th, 3114 BCE. The 14th baktun is a cycle of 144,000 days, which is equivalent to 394.3 years in the Gregorian calendar.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, there are 144,000 days in the Mayan calendar 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: How accurate is the Mayan calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The Mayan calendar is a highly accurate system of timekeeping that was able to predict eclipses and other astronomical events with great precision. However, the Mayans did not account for leap years, so their calendar is slightly less accurate than the Gregorian calendar used today.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Did the Mayans predict the end of the world?<\/h3>\n<p>A: No, the Mayans did not predict the end of the world. The end of the 13th baktun in the Long Count calendar, which occurred on December 21st, 2012, was simply the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. The idea that the Mayans predicted the end of the world is a modern myth.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What was the significance of the Mayan calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The Mayan calendar was used for a variety of purposes, including tracking the seasons for agricultural purposes, predicting astronomical events, and determining the dates of important religious and cultural ceremonies.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>While the Mayan calendar may be an ancient system of timekeeping, it is still of interest to many people today. The calendar&#8217;s accuracy and complexity continue to fascinate scholars and laypeople alike, and its legacy can be seen in the modern world in the form of the Gregorian calendar used today.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mayan Calendar was wrong, the \u2018world will end on June 21\u2019, Conspiracy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.lucipost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Mayan-Calendar-lucipost-768x576.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.lucipost.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The end of the world as we know it?\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.nj.com\/resizer\/in_ykXE0NWmT_0EJhQORopvP67M=\/1280x0\/smart\/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/image.nj.com\/home\/njo-media\/width2048\/img\/entertainment_impact\/photo\/mayan-calendar-2012jpg-86eb40bdc8ab8396.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.nj.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Readings by Karen What the Tarot Says about the Mayan Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.readingsbykaren.com\/images\/mayan-tzolkin-days.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.readingsbykaren.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The Mayan Calendar AncientWorldWonders\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.ancientworldwonders.com\/uploads\/posts\/_2012\/The_Mayan_Calendar\/1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.ancientworldwonders.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"More about the new cycle of the Maya calendar Revue Magazine\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.revuemag.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Maya_Spirituality-Calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.revuemag.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mayan Twin Heros Hunahpu and Xbalanque SOLAR LUNAR\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/solarlunar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/mayan-calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>solarlunar.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Paul&#039; Web Logs 2012 Why the World Won&#039;t End\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-q1C662uHcX8\/UNM3YGbSSYI\/AAAAAAAAeLs\/zMO-Yurw0ds\/s1600\/Mayan+Calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>paulcpw.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Read a Mayan CalendarThings to Know Mayan Day\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/mayanday.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-15-1024x768.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>mayanday.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More about the new cycle of the Maya calendar Revue Magazine from www.revuemag.com The Mayan Calendar The Mayan calendar is an ancient system of timekeeping that was&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/458"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=458"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/458\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w4.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=458"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
